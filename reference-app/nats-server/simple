include "./resolver-config"


# The resolver needs a couple of things
# we give the server the signed jwt token of the operator
# (which could be verified by the corresponding private key
# we also tell it what the system account is and what accounts exist in the system
# notice we use the public NKEY of an account as the name with their jwt as the value
# Users that were signed by the account can now sign a nonce on connect and use 
# that to prove they are part of the account.
